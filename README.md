# one2html

one2html lets you convert OneNote® files (sections or whole notebooks)
into HTML.

## Installation

Choose one of the following installation options:

1. Download from [GitHub Releases][latest-releases].

2. Install via [`cargo binstall`][cargo-binstall]:

```sh
cargo binstall one2html
```

3. Build from source:

```sh
cargo install --locked --no-default-features one2html
```

All options require the latest stable [Rust][rust] compiler.

If you are using [a nightly compiler][rust-nightly], you can omit the
`--no-default-features` flag to print stack traces when errors occur during
OneNote file parsing.

## Usage

### Download OneNote files from OneDrive

OneNote files can be retrieved using one of two methods: Either by
using [onedrive-cli] or by downloading a notebook via the OneDrive web UI.
To do this first install `onedrive-cli` following its instructions. After
logging in using `onedrive-cli login`, you can download a section (a single
`.one` file), or a notebook (a folder that contains a `.onetoc2` file along
with other `.one` files):

```sh
# Download a notebook
onedrive-cli ls Documents/
onedrive-cli cp -R :/Documents/Notebook .

# Download a section
onedrive-cli cp -R :/Documents/Notebook/Section.one .
```

Alternatively, to download OneNote notebooks via the OneDrive web UI, follow
these steps:

1. Visit https://onedrive.live.com
2. Select the folder that contains your notebooks. Typically this is
   the _Documents_ folder.
3. Use the _Download_ button from the toolbar to download a ZIP file
   that contains all of your OneNote notebooks.

### Convert OneNote files to HTML

OneNote sections are stored in `.one` files. To convert a section
to HTML run:

```sh
one2html -i Section.one -o ./output_dir/
```

OneNote notebooks are stored as folders that contain a `.onetoc2`
file along with the notebook's sections stored as `.one` files.
To convert a notebook to HTML run:

```sh
one2html -i 'Notebook/Open Notebook.onetoc2' -o ./output_dir/
```

## Limitations

- Due to limitations of the [OneNote parser](https://github.com/msiemens/onenote.rs)
  only files downloaded from OneDrive are supported. This means you can't
  convert files created by the OneNote 2016 desktop application using
  this tool.
